# Relevance in Cryptography:
RSA, which based on the great difficulty of integer factorization, is the most widely-used public-key cryptosystem used in electronic commerce. Euclid algorithm and extended Euclid algorithm are the best algorithms to solve the public key and private key in RSA. Extended Euclid algorithm in IEEE P1363 is improved by eliminating the negative integer operation, which reduces the computing resources occupied by RSA, hence has an important application value.
